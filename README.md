Task 2 – Read me

In this assignment we have developed a data structure, algorithms and Graphical User Interface. The assignment deals with the development of a data structure of deliberate weighted graph. After implement the Data structure, we implement algorithms such as calculation shortest path, if the graph is connected and more.


At first, we did class Dgraph that implements interface graph and represents a deliberate weighted graph. In class Dgraph we did functions such as: remove node, remove edge, connect – that connects between two nodes and more.


Then, we did class Graph_Algo that implements graph_algorithms and represents
