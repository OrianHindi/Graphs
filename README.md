Task 2 – Read me


In this assignment we have developed a data structure, algorithms and Graphical User Interface. The assignment deals with the development of a data structure of deliberate weighted graph. After implement the Data structure, we implement algorithms such as calculation shortest path, if the graph is connected and more.


At first, we did class Dgraph that implements interface graph and represents a deliberate weighted graph. In class Dgraph we did functions such as: remove node, remove edge, connect – that connects between two nodes, edgeSize – returns the number of edges and more functions.


Then, we did class Graph_Algo that implements graph_algorithms and represents collection of algorithms on deliberate weighted graphs. In class Graph_Algo we did functions such as: isConnected that returns true or false whether the graph is connected. graph is connected when it has at least one vertex and there is a path between every pair of vertices. Another function is shortestPathDist that returns the length of the shortest path between src and dest. 


After that, we create class function GUI that represents Graphical User Interface. Its allowed to display a graph, save it, run algorithms on it, and display his results. In Graph_GUI we did functions like: print graph, add edge, add node and more.


We learned a lot from the task, we improved our skills and our knowledge about Object-Oriented Programming, about interface and inheritance. We learned to do Graphical User Interface and worked together as a team.
